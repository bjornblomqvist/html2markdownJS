# html2markdownJS

It takes HTML and returns markdown where possible. Where possible is defined as where we don't lose any data by translating to markdown. An example of this is that no element with a class is translated to markdown.

    Html2Markdown("<ol><li>Hej 1</li><li>Hej 2</li></ol>") === "1. Hej 1\n2. Hej 2";
    
    Html2Markdown('<h1 class="">Heading 1</h1>') === '<h1 class="">Heading 1</h1>'
    
    Html2Markdown($('.forum-post').html());
    
See the spec/test for more examples.
